This repository contains my solutions to the __no-nonsense_ [hackattic](https://hackattic.com/about)'s challenges, which are quite good if you're seaking for inspiration to do some recrational coding.

## Usage

To have the solutions running, first you need to configure the solution by providing both `HACKATTIC_URL` and `ACCESS_TOKEN` with appropiate values. Once obtained, you can run each challenge as follows:
